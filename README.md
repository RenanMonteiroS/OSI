# OSI

OSI is a SSO, used for manipulating users and authentication. 
It's a microservice, which returns a JWT.

All user information are stored in a MongoDB Atlas database.

Supports TOTP (Google Authentication) authentication.

## Installation

### Prerequisites 
* python3
  ```bash
  # RedHat-based distros
  sudo dnf install python3
  # Debian-based distros
  sudo apt-get install python3
  ```

* pip
  ```bash
  python3 -m ensurepip --default-pip
  ```

* Dependencies
  ```bash
  pip install flask flask_cors mongoengine secrets Jinja2 uuid bcrypt smtplib pyjwt pyotp qrcode
  ```

Use the git cli for downloading the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RenanMonteiroS/OSI.git
```

### Configuration
Below is a step by step for configure correctly the app with your company's information:

1. Create a config.conf file with the code below:
   ```
   [DATABASE]
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://user:password@your-cluster/database

   [JWT]
    JWT_SECRET=super-secret-jwt

   [SMTP]
    SMTP_SERVER=smtp.your-smtp-provider.com
    SMTP_PORT=587
    SMTP_USER=your-smtp-user-email@example.com.br
    SMTP_PASSWORD=your-smtp-password
    SMTP_EMAILSENDER=your-smtp-email@example.com.br

   [COMPANY_INFO]
    COMPANY_WEBSITE=https://your-company-website.com.br
    COMPANY_NAME=your-company-name
   ```

2. Alter the variables in `config.conf` file. 
   `[DATABASE]`, `[JWT]` and `[SMTP]` are required
   If your database URI contains special characters (like @, in password), it needs to be converted to [percent encode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding).
   However, Python strings does not works well with percentage characters, so it needs to have one more percentage character. 
   Example.: If your password is abc@123, it needs to be changed to abc%%40123 in the connection string.

3. Add your company logo in the `templates > static > images` folder, with the name `logo.png`. (Not required)

## Endpoints

### /register

**[POST] Method**
Creates a inactive user, with the e-mail, name and encrypted password received.
Also, it generates:
* An activation token (in database), which will be used in [/activate](#activate)
* A QR code with the TOTP used for authentication
* An e-mail, sended for the user's e-mail, with the activation link and the QR Code

**Expects:**
* email: User's e-mail (must be unique)
* name: User's name
* password: User's password

### /activate

**[GET] Method**
Activates previously created user.
[/login](#login) endpoint expects an 'active' user.

**Expects (query param):**
* ?token: User's activationToken

### /login

**[POST] Method**
Generates and returns a JWT token, with `userId`, `userEmail` and a `tokenExpiration` as payload.
The token have an expiration time of 30 minutes.
The generated JWT uses the secret configured in `config.conf` file, in the [JWT] section. 

**Expects:**
* email: User's e-mail (must be unique)
* password: User's password
* mfaKey: Users's TOTP key, generated by Google Authenticator
